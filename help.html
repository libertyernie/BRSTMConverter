<hr/><p><b><a name="filesize"/>Filesize options:</b></p>
<p><span class=bb>Convert to mono:</span> combines the channels into one, while keeping the overall volume.
For an uncompressed stereo file, converting to mono will cut the filesize in half.</p>
<p><span class=bb>Abjust to absolute rate:</span> converts the selected files to the "default rate" specified,
unless their current rate is equal or less. (Raising the sample rate would increase
filesize but not quality.)</p>
<p><span class=bb>Factor of:</span> converts the selected files to a lower sample rate,
equal to the current rate times the number entered (must be between 0 and 1.)
For example, entering 0.5 in this field would cut the sample rate in half.</p>
<p><span class=bb>Default rate:</span> sets the sample rate used for rendering VGM files. It also sets the rate
that files will be converted to if adjust to absolute rate is checked.</p>
<p><span class=bb>Don't go below [number]:</span> don't change the sample rate of the source file if the new rate
would be below the given number. This can be used when adjusting the rate by a factor.</p>

<hr/><p><b><a name="volume"/>Volume options:</b></p>
<p><span class=bb>Adjustment in dB:</span> Makes the audio louder or quieter by the given amount of decibels.</p>
<p><span class=bb>Factor of:</span> Takes an factor by which to amplify the audio. For example,
a value of 2.0 would double the amplitude while a value of 0.5 would cut it in half.</p>

<hr/><p><b><a name="looping"/>Looping options:</b></p>
<p>For looping inputs, such as BRSTM or .hps, the original loop points will be preserved.
This option applies only to non-looping input files such as .wav and .mp3.</p>
<p><span class=bb>Loop start to end:</span> If chosen, Rate Converter will loop normally non-looping input
formats, such as FLAC and MP3.</p>
<p><span class=bb>Ask every time:</span> For BRSTM output format only. This option will display
the BrawlLib conversion dialog to ask for loop points for each BRSTM built.</p>
<p>No matter what is selected, the program will first look for a file called loop.txt,
which should contain information in the format:</p>
<p><span color=red>loopStart loopEnd filename_here.[wav,flac,ogg]</span></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><span color=red>86016 1743439 Lava Reef Zone Act 1.wav</span></p>
<p>If loop.txt has information for a particular file, that will override the value of this drop-down list.</p>

<hr/><p><b><a name="format"/>Format options:</b></p>
<p><span class=bb>Output as:</span> changes the output format. BRSTM (the format used in Super Smash Bros.
Brawl) is the default, but the program can also make output files in Ogg Vorbis, .logg
(looping Ogg), FLAC or WAV formats. If libmp3lame.dll is present in the tools/sox folder,
you can output to MP3 as well. You can get libmp3lame.dll from:
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/ossbuild/source/browse/trunk/Shared/Build/Windows/Win32/bin/libmp3lame-0.dll" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/ossbuild/source/browse/trunk/ Shared/Build/Windows/Win32/bin/libmp3lame-0.dll</a><br />
If you enter your own value into this box, BRSTM Converter will attempt to use SoX to
convert the file to that format.
<a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/Docs/Features" target="_blank">(See also: SoX supported formats)</a></p>

<hr/><p><b><a name="other"/>Other options:</b></p>
<p><span class=bb>show SoX:</span> If checked, command-line windows will appear showing the progress of
the command-line tools used to process the audio. If unchecked, these windows will not appear.</p>
